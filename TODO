Offline First:
    ☐ Dig into some offline strategies (https://web.dev/articles/offline-cookbook)
    ☐ Think about sync strategies and how to handle conflicts
    ☐ Add IndexedDB to cache emails locally (dexie)
    ☐ Add an audit log of user actions 
      - maybe need a log in browser as well as server
    ☐ Detect when the user is offline and display an "offline" indicator
      - think about ideal offline user experience

General:
    ☐ Log external request counts and latency
    ☐ Collect metrics and expose dashboard (Grafana/Prometheus/Loki)
    ☐ Dev mode to surface metrics in the app itself (e.g. cache hit rate, latency, errors, etc.)
